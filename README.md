# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
## Program:
~~~
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by:KARNAM PAREESH NAIDU
#RegisterNumber:25014801
#the number of linearly independent rows and columns in ma given matrix is known as the its rank
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,2,3],[3,6,9]])
result=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(result)
~~~
## Output:
